# EasySessions
A Swift wrapper around NSURLSession to quickly add a basic networking layer to apps

## Goals
- Adhere to KISS
- Create URLs and URL requests in a composite and type-safe manner
- Support for sending the most widely used JSON/plaint-text requests
- Additional layer for further parsing responses (for flexibility)
- No string manipulation for queries, url paths, etc.
- No singletons/globals/statics
- No runtime hackery
